\section{Snapshot 2 -- TestRail Documentation}
%=========================================================

\subsection{Objective}
Snapshot 2 focused on validating the initial core features of our Copilot integration:
time-off request workflows, basic Copilot updates, and the Adaptive Card feedback
mechanism. The goal was to confirm that user-facing flows behaved as expected and that
early integrations with backend components could be exercised in a controlled environment.

\subsection{Test Run Information}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TestRail Project: CS3338-G11-final-project
  \item Test Run Name: Snapshot 2 Test Run
  \item Date Executed: \textit{[fill in]}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related Jira Issues}
CGFP-20, CGFP-21,
CGFP-23, CGFP-24, CGFP-25,
CGFP-26, CGFP-27, CGFP-28, CGFP-29

\subsection{Test Cases Included}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TC-01 Submit Time-Off Request via Copilot
  \item TC-02 Time-Off Request Validation \& Save
  \item TC-03 Time-Off Request Display
  \item TC-08 Ticket Updates Display and Persist
  \item TC-09 Feedback Adaptive Card Loads
  \item TC-10 Feedback Submission \& Storage
  \item TC-12 Backend Connectivity \& Error Handling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}
Snapshot 2 established the foundation for user interaction by testing time-off submission,
feedback mechanisms, and early data-handling behaviors. These tests provided insight into
which components were stable and which required refinement heading into Snapshot 3.

\section{Snapshot 3 -- TestRail Documentation}
%=========================================================

\subsection{Objective}
Snapshot 3 targeted the mid-stage functionality of the system, including IT ticket creation,
ticket storage, ticket tracking, and logging. This phase ensured data persisted correctly
across systems and validated Copilot’s ability to retrieve and summarize ticket information.

\subsection{Test Run Information}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TestRail Project: CS3338-G11-final-project
  \item Test Run Name: Snapshot 3 Test Run
  \item Date Executed: \textit{[fill in]}

\subsection{Test Cases Included}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TC-04 Create IT Ticket via Copilot
  \item TC-05 Save IT Ticket to SharePoint / PDHelpDesk
  \item TC-06 Ticket Save Failure Handling
  \item TC-07 Track IT Ticket in Copilot
  \item TC-08 Ticket Updates Display and Persist
  \item TC-11 MCLE Logging for Key Actions
  \item TC-12 Backend Connectivity \& Error Handling
  \item TC-18 End-to-End Happy Path Scenario
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}
Snapshot 3 expanded system coverage to include backend persistence, ticket data reliability,
and operational logging. These tests confirmed interactions between Copilot and external
systems, setting the stage for the refinement tasks addressed in Snapshot 4.

\section{Snapshot 4 -- TestRail Documentation}
%=========================================================

\subsection{Objective}
Snapshot 4 served as the final integration phase, focusing on user tracking, record linkage,
file retrieval behavior, error handling for invalid commands, and full regression testing
across the system.

\subsection{Test Run Information}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TestRail Project: CS3338-G11-final-project
  \item Test Run Name: Snapshot 4 Test Run
  \item Date Executed: \textit{[fill in]}
\end{itemize}

CGFP-35, CGFP-36, CGFP-37, CGFP-38,
CGFP-39,
CGFP-10, CGFP-11, CGFP-13

\subsection{Test Cases Included}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TC-13 User Tracking for Actions
  \item TC-14 Correct User Linked to Tickets/Requests
  \item TC-15 File / Document Search
  \item TC-16 Incorrect File Retrieval Handling
  \item TC-17 Handle Incorrect or Unsupported Commands
  \item TC-18 End-to-End Happy Path Scenario
  \item [Optional] TC-01 or TC-04 for regression
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}
Snapshot 4 ensured that the system behaved consistently under realistic usage patterns by
testing user attribution, file retrieval accuracy, command validation, and final system-wide
integration. These tests represent the final quality assessment for the project.
